# pyRoovit
(WIP)

# What is this?
PyRoovit is/will be a toolbar for the use with pyRevit built by Gavin Crump (aka Aussie BIM Guru). Having used and taught Dynamo for many years now, he's come to see pyRevit as a natural 'next step' for users looking to package up more efficient, stable and scalable tools to organisations. Over time, tools will be introduced to this resource in tandem with related educational content on the Aussie BIM Guru YouTube channel.

# Who is it for?
These tools will generally be aimed towards architects looking to get more out of Revit and/or learn more about pyRevit. Expect tools to typically focus on efficiency gains usually made in the mid to late stages of project delivery (as well as some purely miscellaneous tools).

# Feature requests
Whilst the author can't guarantee they'll be able to add everything and anything, feel free to add tool/script ideas on the github or by contacting aussiebimguru@gmail.com.
